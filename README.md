# Systems Thinking Skill for Claude Code

A skill that helps you analyze complex problems using Systems Thinking approaches. Rather than prescribing solutions, it guides you through questions and observations to uncover deeper insights about the systems you're working with.

## What It Does

This skill activates when you're facing multi-factor problems where quick fixes tend to fail. It helps you:

- **Expand your perspective** beyond the immediate, visible problem
- **Trace causal chains** to understand where issues actually originate
- **Identify feedback loops** that amplify or dampen behaviors in your system
- **Surface hidden assumptions** that may be constraining your thinking
- **Visualize system dynamics** through Causal Loop Diagrams

## When to Use It

Invoke the skill when you encounter situations involving:

- Root cause analysis ("Why does this keep happening?")
- Unintended consequences of past decisions
- Problems that persist despite repeated interventions
- Complex dependencies between teams, systems, or processes
- Planning where you need to anticipate ripple effects

**Trigger phrases:** "systems thinking," "systemic," "feedback loops," "unintended consequences," "root cause," "interconnected"

## Frameworks Included

### Questions of a Systems Thinker

The default framework for most analyses. Guides you through:

- **Perspective shifts** - seeing the problem from different roles and altitudes
- **Time and change** - tracing history and anticipating delayed effects
- **System structure** - mapping connections, feedback loops, and emergent properties
- **Assumptions** - surfacing what you're taking for granted

### Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs)

Visual tool for mapping feedback dynamics. Automatically offered when:

- You explicitly ask for a CLD or diagram
- You've described 3+ interconnected variables
- You mention feedback loops, vicious/virtuous cycles, or reinforcing/balancing dynamics

CLDs help you see circular causation patterns and identify where interventions might have the most leverage.

## Conversational Approach

The skill works iteratively rather than dumping frameworks on you:

1. Offers one lens or question at a time
2. Provides a brief explanation of the concept
3. Asks a probing question to deepen your thinking
4. Uses your response to guide what to explore next

This approach helps you discover insights rather than just receive advice.

## Example Use Cases

- Understanding why a team's velocity keeps dropping despite process changes
- Analyzing why technical debt accumulates faster than you pay it down
- Planning a reorganization and anticipating second-order effects
- Post-mortem analysis that goes beyond proximate causes
- Designing incentive structures that don't backfire
