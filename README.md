# Systems Thinking Skill for Claude Code

You've fixed this problem before. Twice. Maybe three times. And here it is again, wearing a different hat.

This skill helps you stop chasing symptoms and start understanding why the problem keeps showing up.

## The Problem This Solves

Most of us jump straight to solutions. We see something broken, we fix it. We see a slowdown, we add more people. We see conflict, we move someone to a different team.

But here's the thing: **the cause of your problem rarely lives where you first notice it.** That issue that keeps recurring? It's probably a symptom of something happening upstream. That slowdown? It might be created by decisions made three departments away. That conflict? It could be the predictable result of a structure nobody questioned.

Systems Thinking helps you zoom out, follow the real trail, and find where your efforts will actually make a difference.

## What You Get

This skill guides you through:

- **Expanding your view** - What bigger picture is this problem part of? What would someone in a different role see here?
- **Following the trail** - Where did this really start? What happened in the past that shaped what you're seeing today?
- **Finding the loops** - What's making this problem grow? What's keeping it stuck in place?
- **Questioning assumptions** - What are you taking for granted that might be wrong?
- **Drawing the picture** - When you've identified enough moving parts, Causal Loop Diagrams make the connections visible

## When to Use It

Consider this skill when you're dealing with:

- Problems that keep coming back no matter what you try
- Situations where fixing one thing seems to break another
- Figuring out why something went wrong at a deeper level than "someone made a mistake"
- Planning ahead when you need to anticipate ripple effects
- Reviews that keep pointing to the same issues
- Messy situations with lots of moving parts and dependencies

**Trigger phrases:** "systems thinking," "systemic," "feedback loops," "unintended consequences," "root cause," "interconnected"

## The Tools

### Questions of a Systems Thinker

The main tool. Instead of overwhelming you with a framework, it offers one question at a time:

- **Shift your view** - What do you see from way up high? What do you see in the details? What would a customer see?
- **Look at time** - What happened months ago that might explain today? What might happen months from now?
- **Map the connections** - What else is this linked to? Where does one thing's output become another thing's input?
- **Check your assumptions** - What are you taking for granted here?

### Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs)

Think of these as maps showing how things circle back on themselves. When you describe something like "stress leads to mistakes, mistakes lead to rework, rework leads to more stress" - that's a loop that feeds itself. CLDs make these patterns visible so you can see where to step in.

The skill offers to draw one when:
- You ask for it (or mention "CLD" or "Causal Loop Diagram")
- You've described 3 or more things that affect each other
- You're talking about vicious cycles, virtuous cycles, or situations that feed on themselves

## How It Works
The skill doesn't lecture. It asks questions, one at a time:

1. Offers a question relevant to your situation
2. Explains briefly why this angle matters
3. Asks a follow-up to deepen your thinking
4. Uses your answer to decide what to explore next

The goal is discovery together, not advice from on high. You understand your situation better than any framework does. The skill just helps you see what you might be missing.

## Real Examples

- **"Why do we keep falling behind?"** - Instead of adding more process, trace what's actually eating up time. Map the loops. Often you'll find that the "solution" to a previous problem is now creating this one.

- **"We're drowning in shortcuts and workarounds"** - Map the loop: pressure to deliver → cutting corners → accumulated mess → slower work → more pressure. Then look for what should be limiting this cycle but isn't.

- **"We reorganized and nothing changed"** - Follow the trail. Moving boxes on an org chart doesn't automatically change incentives, relationships, or how information flows. What did you assume would change that didn't?

## The Key Point

Quick fixes feel productive. They're fast. They're visible. And they usually make the underlying problem worse.

Systems Thinking takes longer. It means admitting you don't fully understand the situation yet. But it's how you find changes that actually stick.
