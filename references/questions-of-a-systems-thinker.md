# Questions of a Systems Thinker

Offer one question at a time. Explain the concept briefly. Let the user's response guide what to explore next.

## Perspective Shifts

**Take another perspective:** What would someone in a different role see here? A developer, a customer, and an executive often experience the same situation very differently.

**Zoom in and out:** What do you see from a 30,000-foot view? What do you see in the fine details? You'll spot different patterns at each altitude.

**Examine your biases:** What cognitive biases might you be bringing to this situation? Your mental shortcuts can blind you to parts of the system you're not predisposed to see.

**Consider other mental models:** What other frameworks might apply here? A single mental model only captures part of reality.

## Time & Change

**Look for delayed effects:** What might happen in 5 weeks, 5 months, 5 years? Systems respond slowly. The consequences of today's decision may not show up for months.

**Trace history:** What has happened in the past, especially the distant past? Current behavior is often shaped by events and decisions made long ago.

**Track how parts evolve:** How have the parts of this system changed over time? How might they change going forward? The parts themselves transform — nothing stays static.

## System Structure

**Map connections:** What else is this part connected to? Every element influences other elements, often in ways you don't expect.

**Identify feedback loops:** Where does the output of one part feed back into another? Feedback loops either amplify small changes (reinforcing) or dampen them (balancing).

**Expect multiple causes:** What other factors contributed to this situation? There's rarely a single cause. Look for the web of contributing forces.

**Look for emergent properties:** What behaviors exist in this system that wouldn't exist in its individual parts? Some properties only appear when the parts interact.

**Recognize the whole:** What does this system do that none of its parts could do alone? The system is more than the sum of its parts.

## Assumptions

**Surface and validate assumptions:** What are you taking for granted here? Unexamined assumptions constrain your view of what's possible and what's causing the problem.
